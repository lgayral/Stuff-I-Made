# Project Euler

[Project Euler](projecteuler.net/) is an online collection of challenging problems that usually involve both smart mathematics and efficient algorithms for the solutions to compute in a reasonnable amount of time.
It is considered a bad practice to spoil the solutions for problems beyond the first undred, so I show here my solutions only for the problems around this threshold.
